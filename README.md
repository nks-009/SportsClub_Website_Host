website link https://plain-train-pike.cyclic.app/

I developed this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB. Feature's, Users must register to become a member of the sports club website. Without registering, user's won't get the apply option. Once registered, users can log in to the website, and only registered users can access the site's features. After logging in, users can apply for club membership by selecting their desired state where user's want to be a member of this club. Based on the user's state selection, the website will display all available clubs in that state. Once the user selects a club, they will be prompted to pay for their membership. After payment is confirmed, the user will receive a confirmation message from the website.
