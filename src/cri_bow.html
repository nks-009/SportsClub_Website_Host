                        Harbhajan Singh (born 3 July 1980) is a member of parliament in Rajya Sabha and an
                        Indian retired cricketer and cricket commentator, who played for the Indian national cricket
                        team from 1998 - 2016. Singh was a right-arm spin bowler. In Indian domestic cricket he played
                        for Punjab cricket team, in IPL for Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight
                        Riders franchise.

                        He occasionally worked as captain of Mumbai Indians and captained Punjab for the 2012–13 Ranji
                        Trophy season. Under his leadership, Mumbai won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20.

                        Singh made his Test and One Day International (ODI) debuts in early 1998. His career was
                        initially affected by investigations into the legality of his bowling action, as well as several
                        disciplinary incidents. However, in 2001, with leading leg spinner Anil Kumble injured,
                        Harbhajan's career was resuscitated after Indian captain Sourav Ganguly called for his inclusion
                        in the team; he took 32 wickets in the following series, becoming the first Indian bowler to
                        take a hat-trick in Test cricket.
