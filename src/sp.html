    <p class="midcon">The Sport Club Program at this club is comprised of sport clubs formed, developed, governed,
        and administered by the student membership working in conjunction with the Office of Intramurals and
        Recreation, a unit of the Division of Student Life. The key to the success of this program is student
        leadership, interest, involvement, and participation. Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical
        activity or game that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment
        to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized
        participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
        through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In
        certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner;
        in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a
        "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner
        and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues
        make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

                players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,
                each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding
                team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the
                other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has
                one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler
                aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls
                the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends of the
                pitch, which results in one run. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that
                is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football
                (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or
                Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
                These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                different parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.The expansion and
                cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
                influence outside the directly controlled Empire.
